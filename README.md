# iris-classification-project
This project implements a machine learning model to classify Iris flowers into different species using logistic regression. The classification is based on sepal and petal features.

## Overview

The Iris Classification Project uses the popular Iris dataset, which includes measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width for three species of Iris flowers: setosa, versicolour, and virginica. The goal is to train a logistic regression model to predict the species based on these features.
